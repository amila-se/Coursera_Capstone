They decide to move and settle down in London due to many reasons such as work commitment changes, looking for better living conditions, etc. However, there are certain things they have to consider before moving in. London housing and rental prices are among the highest in the world and can eat up to a significant portion of their income. Furthermore, other living costs such as public transport fares, owning a vehicle & driving are not cheap either. Considering these and many other facts, it is relatively tough matter to decide to where to settle down within London."
